```
Here, I have implemented the basic implemented of GraphQL.

GraphQL is a query language for APIs and runtime for execution those queries with existing data. It was developed by Facebook to address the limitations of traditional Restful APIs.
It offers a more efficient and flexible approach to data fetching by allowing clients to specify the exact data they need.
